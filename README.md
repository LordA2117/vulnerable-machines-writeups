# Vulnerable Machine Writeups

My writeups for any machines I solve

## Author's Note:
Obviously these are all pretty badly made, and where I have used anyone else's writeup I have made sure to include it. These are not really meant to help anyone except me so if by some miracle you stumble upon this I am sorry ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. 

If you do want me to put any effort into this I suppose you can drop a star on the github repo for this. Then I might at least know its not entirely private :).
