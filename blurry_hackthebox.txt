I am going to try and use the regreSSHion exploit since this version of SSH seems vulnerable. (didnt work)

Somehow the exploit for ClearML CVE-2024-24590 worked.

https://github.com/HexDoesRandomShit/ClearML-vulnerability-exploit-RCE-2024-CVE-2024-24590-


Note that we have to initialize clearml for both of these, instructions for which can be found in the second link.

Found an ssh private key, which I used to connect to the server.

Now for privec I used this writeup:
